tdwm - dynamic window manager
============================
tdwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X forked from dwm.


Requirements
------------
In order to build tdwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (tdwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install tdwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running tdwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start tdwm using startx:

    exec tdwm

In order to connect tdwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec tdwm

(This will start tdwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

The repository comes with tdwmclock.sh, an example of a status bar generator.
It simply sets the root window name to the current time every minute. You can
make it display arbitarary data by just changing the echo argument.
To use it, put something like this in your .xinitrc:

    tdwmclock.sh &
    exec tdwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of tdwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
